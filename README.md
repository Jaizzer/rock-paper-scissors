## Introduction

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a fun and quick way to challenge yourself against the computer. It's a game of chance and strategy where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

When you're ready to play, just head over to the **[live demo](https://jaizzer.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)** and start having fun!

## Gameplay

When you visit the live demo link, you'll be presented with buttons labeled 'Rock,' 'Paper,' and 'Scissors.' Click on the button representing your choice, and the computer will randomly select its move. The game will then display the selections, announce the winner of the round, and keep track of the score. The first player to reach a score of 5 wins the game.

## How It Works

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the structure of the game, including buttons for the player's choices and placeholders for displaying the game state. The JavaScript file contains the logic for generating the computer's choice, determining the winner of each round, and updating the score.
